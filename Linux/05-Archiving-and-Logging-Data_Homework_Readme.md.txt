## Week 5 Homework: Archiving and Logging Data

This unit's homework is designed to solidify the following concepts and tools:

- Create a `tar` archive that excludes a directory using the `--exclude=` command option.
- Manage backups using cron jobs.
- Write bash scripts to create system resource usage reports.
- Perform log filtering using `journalctl`.
- Perform priority-based log filtering and log file creation using `rsyslog`.
- Manage log file sizes using `logrotate`.
- Create an auditing system to check for policy and file violations using `auditd`.

#### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

Creating `tar` archives is something you must do everyday in your role at Credico Inc. In this section, you will extract and exclude specific files and directories to help speed up your workflow.

To get started, navigate to the `~/Projects` directory where your downloaded `TarDocs.tar` archive file should be.

1. Extract the `TarDocs.tar` archive file into the current directory (`~/Projects`). Afterwards, list the directory's contents with `ls` to verify that you have extracted the archive properly.

tar -xvf TarDocs.tar
~/Projects/TarDocs ls

Verify that there is a `Java` subdirectory in the `TarDocs/Documents` folder by running: `ls -l ~/Projects/TarDocs/Documents/`.

2. Create a `tar` archive called `Javaless_Docs.tar` that excludes the `Java` directory from the newly extracted `TarDocs/Document/` directory.

Tar cvf JavaLess_Docs.tar --exclude TarDocs/Documents/Java TarDocs 

3. Verify that this new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive does not contain the `Java` subdirectory by using `tar` to list the contents of `Javaless_Docs.tar` and then piping `grep` to search for `Java`.

Tar tvf JavaLess_Docs.tar | grep Java 

**Bonus** 
- Create an incremental archive called `logs_backup.tar.gz` that contains only changed files by examining the `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory. You will need `sudo` for this command.

Sudo tar cvzf logs_backup.tar.gz --listed-incremental+snapshot-file /var/log

#### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

In response to a ransomware attack, you have been tasked with creating an archiving and backup scheme to mitigate against CryptoLocker malware. This attack would encrypt the entire server’s hard disk and can only be unlocked using a 256-bit digital key after a Bitcoin payment is delivered.

For this task, you'll need to create an archiving cron job using the following specifications: 

   - This cron job should create an archive of the following file: `/var/log/auth.log`.
   - The filename and location of the archive should be: `/auth_backup.tgz`.
   - The archiving process should be scheduled to run every Wednesday at 6 a.m.
   - Use the correct archiving zip option to compress the archive using `gzip`.

1. To get started creating cron jobs, run the command `crontab -e`. Make sure that your cron job line includes the following:

      - The schedule (minute, hour, etc.) in cron format.
            - **Hint:** Reference the helpful site [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) as needed.
      - An archive (`tar`) command with three options.
      - The path to save the archive to
      - The path of the file to archive.
  
  0 6 * * 3 tar -czf ~/TarDocs/auth_backup.tgz  /var/log/auth.log

#### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

Portions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act require organizations to maintain a regular backup regimen for the safe and secure storage of financial data.

You'll first need to set up multiple backup directories. Each directory will be dedicated to housing text files that you will create with different kinds of system information.

For example, the directory `freemem` will be used to store **free memory** system information files.

1. Using brace expansion, create the following four directories:
      - `~/backups/freemem`
      - `~/backups/diskuse`
      - `~/backups/openlist`
      - `~/backups/freedisk`
      
mkdir -p ./backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}
~/backups ls

  
Now you will create a script that will execute various Linux tools to parse information about the system. Each of these tools should output results to a text file inside its respective system information directory.

-  For example: `cpu_usage_tool > ~/backups/cpuuse/cpu_usage.txt`

 In the above example, the `cpu_usage_tool` command will output CPU usage information into a `cpu_usage.txt` file.

To get started with setting up your script up in your `home` directory, do the following:

- Navigate to your `home` directory by running: `cd ~/`

- Run the command `nano system.sh` to open a new Nano window.

**Note**: If you're unsure how to get started, we included a `system.sh` starter file. Use that as a guide.

2. Edit the `system.sh` script file so that it that does the following:

      - Prints the amount of free memory on the system and saves it to `~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt`.
      
      - Prints disk usage and saves it to `~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt`.

      - Lists all open files and saves it to `~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt`.

      - Prints file system disk space statistics and saves it to `~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt`.

      free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
      
      df -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
      
      lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
      
      df -h > /backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

3. Save this file and make sure to change or modify the `system.sh` file permissions so that it is executable.

chmod +x system.sh (add sudo to the command if permissions are needed)

You should now have an executable `system.sh` file within your home `~/` directory.

- Test the script with `sudo ./system.sh`.

- **Note**: If it appears, ignore the warning: `lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse.gvfsd-fuse file system /run/user/1001/gvfs Output information may be incomplete.` 

**Optional** 
- Confirm the script ran properly by navigating to any of subdirectories in the `~/backup/` directory and using `cat <filename>` to view the contents of the backup files.

sudo ./system.sh

ls in each subdirectory followed by cat <file>.txt

**Bonus**
- Automate your script `system.sh` by adding it to the `weekly` system-wide cron directory.

sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.d

#### Step 4: Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

There was a suspicious login from a host on the network during the early morning hours when the office was closed. The senior security manager tasked you with filtering through log files to determine if a system breach occurred.

**Hint:** Remember that `journal` tracks each log relative to each system boot. Also, keep in mind that you can sort messages by priority, relative boot, and specific units.

1. Use `journalctl` to perform a log search that returns all messages, with priorities from emergency to error, since the current system boot.

Journalctl -b -1 -p “emerg” .. “err

2. Use `journalctl` to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot. You will likely have to pipe this output to `less` if it doesn't fit on the screen.

   - The unit you want is `systemd-journald`.
   
Journalctl -b -u systemd-journald | less

3. Use `journalctl` to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two.

Sudo journalctl --vacuum-files=2

**Bonus**
- Use `journalctl` to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save the results to a file named `Priority_High.txt` in `/home/student/` directory.

Journalctl -p 0..2 >Priority_High.txt

- Automate the last task by creating a cron job that runs daily in the root crontab.

0 0 * * * journalctl -p 0..2 > Priority_High.txt /home/sysadmin

#### Step 5. Create Priority-Based Log Files

Your organization is constantly bombarded with spam messages, a type of social engineering attack. To address this, you’ve decided to implement a priority-based log filtering system to monitor access to the mail daemon.   

To get started with editing `rsyslog` configurations from any directory within your terminal, run `sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf` to edit the `rsyslog` config file.

1. Configure `rsyslog` to record mail log message for all priorities except debug to the `/var/log/mail.log` directory.

Mail.!debug   /var/mail.log

**Bonus**
- Configure `rsyslog` to record boot log messages for all priorities except info and debug to the `/var/log/boot.log` directory.

boot.!info,!debug  /var/log/boot.log

#### Step 6. Manage Log File Sizes

You realize that the spam messages are making the size of the log files unmanageable.

You’ve decided to implement log rotation in order to preserve log entries and keep log file sizes more manageable. You’ve also chosen to compress logs during rotation to preserve disk space and lower costs.

1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` config file. You don't need to work out of any specific directory as you are using the full configuration file path. Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log` directory using the following settings:

      - Rotates weekly.

      - Rotates only the seven most recent logs.

      - Does not rotate empty logs.

      - Delays compression.

      - Skips error messages for missing logs and continues to next log.

      Don't forget to surround your rotation rules with curly braces `{}`.
      
/var/log.auth.log {
weekly
rotate 7
notifempty
delaycompression
missingok
}

#### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

In an effort to help mitigate against future attacks, you have decided to create an event monitoring system that specifically generates reports whenever new accounts are created or modified, and when any modifications are made to authorization logs.

1. Verify the `auditd` service is active using the `systemctl` command.

service auditd status

2. Run `sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf` to edit the `auditd` config file using the following parameters. You can run this command from anywhere using the terminal.

      - Number of retained logs is seven.

      - Maximum log file size is 35.
      
 sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf

3. Next, run `sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` to edit the rules for `auditd`. Create rules that watch the following paths:

      - For `/etc/shadow`, set `wra` for the permissions to monitor and set the `keyname` for this rule to `hashpass_audit`.

      - For `/etc/passwd`, set `wra` for the permissions to monitor and set the `keyname` for this rule to `userpass_audit`.

      - For `/var/log/auth.log`, set `wra` for the permissions to monitor and set the `keyname` for this rule to `authlog_audit`.
      
 sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
 
 sudo auditctl -l 
 
4. Restart the `auditd` daemon.

 sudo systemctl restart auditd

5. Perform a listing that reveals all existing `auditd` rules.

auditctl    
 
6. Using `sudo`, produce an audit report that returns results for all user authentications.

sudo aureport -au

7. Now you will shift into hacker mode. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications. 

sudo aureport -m 

8. Use `auditctl` to add another rule that watches the `/var/log/cron` directory.

sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron

9. Perform a listing that reveals changes to the `auditd` rules took affect.

sudo auditctl -l
